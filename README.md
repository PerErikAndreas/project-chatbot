# Project-Chatbot

The assignment was to create a chatbot with javascript, css and html. 

## The problem

I approached this task by start watching all attached videos about javascript. Then I coded along with Jennie creating the ground for the HTML and CSS and some of the Javascript. Attached in the folder provided in github for this task there was some prewritten java-code. I wrote down with comments what I thought should be done and started to look (google) for ways to do it. That was hard and felt that I needed a wholeistic view on how to complete the code so I looked at some of the previus technigo students code and tried out different functions they had been using.
