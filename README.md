# Project-Chatbot

The assignment was to create a chatbot with javascript, css and html. 

## The problem

I approached this task by start watching all attached videos about javascript. Then I coded along with Jennie creating the ground for the HTML and CSS and some of the Javascript. Attached in the folder provided in github for this task there was some prewritten java-code. I wrote down with comments what I thought should be done and started to look (google) for ways to do it. That was hard and felt that I needed a wholeistic view on how to complete the code so I looked at some of the previus technigo students code and tried out different ways that they had been using.

I decided to make my chat-bot to my friends coffee-company Lemmelkaffe. They have this backstory about how the animal lemmings collect the beans and go with the golfstream to the articcircle etc etc.. 

Their webpage is on swedish so the conversation with the lemmings are to (sorry). (plan is to have a english version to).
